### What is this repository for? ###

Test task

- Liking doesn't work on android yet :(
- app is written in Redux-style but not with Redux, you can check "reducers" in App component
- I used ScrollView as a swipe gesture handler to achieve 60fps, another options could be: 
	- interactable (not mantained)
	- react-native-gesture-handler (not stable yet)
	- handling gestures on js thread (not good because of the react native bridge limitations)


### How do I get set up? ###

yarn install

react-native run-ios
